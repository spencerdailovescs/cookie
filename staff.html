Growing up in the famed 123 Sesame Street, Spencer's grandfather (commonly known as "The Cookie Monster") instilled in him a deep love and reverence for the cookie. His dreams came true when he met the rest of our team and opened the first "Cookies^2" location in 30,000 BC! <p>

He then sanctioned a worldwide search for new toppings that had not yet be discovered, many of which he patented and we serve today!  <p>
